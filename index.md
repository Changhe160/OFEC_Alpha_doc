This is an open source project with the aim of providing an open framework for evolutionary computation (OFEC). OFEC includes fundamental structures of population based algorithms, problems, and algorithms’ performance metrics. Based on this framework, you can easily implement your own algorithms and compare their performance with other algorithms. This project is totally for research purpose. I would like to encourage you to take part in this project and let’s together make the research life easy, comfortable, and efficient for you and for everyone.

#### Features

- OFEC was implemented in C++ language based on several modern C++ design techniques.
- It supports solution representation in continuous and combinatorial space, or using hybrid encoding schemes. 
- It can be run in both Windows and Linux environments with a single thread or multi-thread mode.

OFEC has three basic components: algorithm, problem, and performance measurements. The benchmark problems and optimization algorithms implemented in this platform are listed in the [**algorithm list**](Tutorial/algorithm list) and the [**problem list**](Tutorial/problem list).
